	desc = "   </br>''Before the TEN and the FOUR, there was ONE.'' </br>  </br>After the Comet Syon's impact, Psydon fell silent. Most had feared that He had undertaken the ultimate sacrifice to save this world from the Archdevil's rampage, and - in the midst of mourning - turned their prayers to lesser gods. Yet, throughout the centuries, there always remained those who kept faith in Psydon above all else: be it in one way, or another. </br>  </br>Peppered throughout the world are a hundred denominations, all with their own unique - and oft-contradictory - beliefs in Psydon. Yet, above all else, there lies one denomination that seems to always reap the candelight: the Orthodoxy. </br>  </br>Founded within the ancient kingdom of Otava, the Orthodoxists believe that Psydon still lives, and is soon destined to return. Unanswered prayers and faltering miracles are merely tests of faith, nothing more. While the Pantheon's saints might be venerable, they are still His children: and as such, they remain wholly subservient to His divine authority.</br>  </br>The world is ending, but there is still hope. He has not yet abandoned us: we must work against those that'd besmirch us as 'zealots' and 'heathens', if we are to be reunited with Him once more. Only through returning to Psydon, will everyone be saved."
